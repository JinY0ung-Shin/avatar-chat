/**
 * The 시작하기 checklist predicates, shared by the explore progress card and the
 * welcome modal's quick steps. They lived as two hand-copied `$:` blocks and had
 * already drifted: the modal counted a stored CONFLUENCE_PAT as 권한 연결,
 * explore did not, so the same account read "완료" in one surface and "필요" in
 * the other.
 *
 * Reconciled on the SUPERSET (the modal's rule): any ONE of a git token, an SSH
 * key, or a Confluence PAT means the avatar can act on the user's behalf
 * somewhere, which is what the step promises. A stricter "all of them" reading
 * would leave the item permanently red for people who only ever need one.
 *
 * Callers pass whatever they hold — `$appState.user` (nullable) or a `User` prop
 * — so every predicate accepts null and answers false for a signed-out state.

/**
 * Claude's server-side image resize, ported from Anthropic's vision docs
 * (platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/vision and
 * /vision-coordinates, read 2026-09-02), plus a header-only JPEG size reader.
 *
 * WHY this exists (#66): Claude answers a "click at these pixels" question in
 * the pixel space of the image it SEES — that is, AFTER the API downscales an
 * upload to the serving model's native vision size. A browser screenshot that
 * arrives BIGGER than that size therefore comes back with every coordinate off
 * by one constant factor (the field report: a menu item hit one row too high;
 * pure scale, zero offset). Keeping pixel-mode click_at honest means knowing
 * that native size, so the extension pre-fits a viewport capture to it and the
 * server warns when an older extension build did not. Both sides compute it
 * from the same rules — keep this file in sync with extension/axtree.js's
 * vision* helpers.
 *
 * The target is always the STANDARD tier. Noah cannot know the serving model's
 * resolution tier (model ids are admin-configured aliases), and standard is the
 * size every Claude model sees at least: a high-resolution-tier model handed a
 * standard-fitted image merely gets a smaller one, never wrong coordinates.

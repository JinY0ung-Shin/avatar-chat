// Shared arg guards for the repo clone/commit/push paths (knowledgeRepo.ts,
// groupKnowledgeRepo.ts, gitRepos.ts, marketplace.ts). A value git would read
// as an option (e.g. an identity or branch starting with "-") is a security hole,
// so these guards are intentionally identical across all call sites — kept
// in one place rather than copy-pasted. The identity/branch checks fall back to a
// safe default rather than fail; `assertSafeGitValue` throws.

// `scheme::` remote-helper syntax (e.g. `ext::sh -c …`, `fd::`) makes git run an
// arbitrary transport helper as a subprocess — a command-execution vector, and
// this process holds SESSION_SECRET. A `--` separator does NOT stop it: the
// scheme is part of the URL, not an option.
//
// git's own default protocol policy currently refuses `ext` ("fatal: transport
// 'ext' not allowed"), but that is git's default, not our guard — a
// `protocol.ext.allow`/`GIT_ALLOW_PROTOCOL` setting or a differently-built git
// re-opens it. Reject the syntax here so no clone path depends on that default.
//
// No legitimate branch, path, repo shorthand, or https/ssh URL we accept contains
// `::`, so rejecting it is safe across every value kind (sec-03).

/**
 * THE single arg-safety validator for every git value that reaches a `git`

 * `gitRepos.ts` had the remote-helper check while the knowledge/group clone
 * paths only checked for a leading dash (T3.8).
 *
 * This is arg-safety ONLY. It deliberately does NOT judge the transport or host
 * (a bare local path is a legitimate repo source — `register_repo` accepts one by
 * design, and the offline tests clone from local bare remotes). Source/host
 * POLICY belongs at the entry point that claims it: see `isInternalGitSource`.

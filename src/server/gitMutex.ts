/**
 * Serialize git operations that touch the same on-disk clone.
 *
 * Multiple chat turns (and the HTTP routes) can hit the same working tree
 * concurrently: every group member's turn loads skills from the SAME group
 * clone at ${dataDir}/group-knowledge/<groupId> while a group admin commits and
 * pushes; a single user's concurrent turns race on their personal knowledge
 * clone too. Interleaved `fetch`/`checkout`/`add`/`commit`/`push` on one
 * working tree corrupt the index or each other's staged state.
 *
 * `withRepoLock` runs `fn` exclusively per `key` by chaining each call onto the
 * previous one for that key (a per-key promise queue). Callers serialize only
 * against the same key; different repos run in parallel.
 *
 * IMPORTANT — deadlock avoidance: the queue is NOT reentrant. A function held
 * under `withRepoLock(key, …)` must never call `withRepoLock(key, …)` again for
 * the same key (it would await a promise that can only settle after itself).
 * Callers wrap the OUTERMOST operation for a clone path and use lock-free
 * internals below it.

/**
 * Pick the copy a share applies to. `markerNameOf` reads a copy's provenance
 * marker `skillName` — the share's name AT LEARN TIME — and `share` carries its
 * current name plus its rename trail, so a copy learned before the share
 * followed a rename still resolves.
 *
 * Exact matches WIN OUTRIGHT: the trail is consulted only when NO copy names
 * the share's current name. A name the share left behind is FREED, and an
 * unrelated new share may take it over — so a trail hit sitting next to an
 * exact hit belongs to that other share, and treating the two as
 * interchangeable is what lets a widened trail capture a stranger's copy.
 *
 * Anything that doesn't resolve to exactly one copy is `ambiguous`, never a
 * guess: callers fail closed (refuse the update, light no badge).
 *
 * Callers pre-filter `copies` to markers written by the share's OWNER.

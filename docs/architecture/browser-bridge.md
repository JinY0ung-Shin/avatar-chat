The durable direction (relay into the user's own browser, the extension never runs page JS, the
default-deny `CDP_ALLOWLIST` is the boundary, everything the page returns is untrusted) lives in
[`../../CLAUDE.md`](../../CLAUDE.md). Cautions for the shipped folder itself — `BUNDLE_FILES`,
`BINARY_BUNDLE_FILES`, the min-compatible ceiling — are in
[`../../extension/CLAUDE.md`](../../extension/CLAUDE.md). The user-facing install and allowlist-policy
guide is [`../../extension/README.md`](../../extension/README.md) (Korean).

| Page | Open it when |
|---|---|
| [contract.md](browser-bridge/contract.md) | Adding or changing ANY op — the five hand-synced layers, extension version compatibility, the composer's four badge rungs, and how `screenshot` rides the run's vision policy. |
| [addressing.md](browser-bridge/addressing.md) | You need to reach a specific element: `click_at`'s two unrelated modes, how long a uid stays valid, the pinned working tab, the settle tail, and the three ways frames are walked. |
| [actions.md](browser-bridge/actions.md) | You are changing what an op *does*: verified writes and their four end states, `type` routing by control kind, selects, navigation and the destination-based origin gate, click guards, audit rows, and the no-JS constraint. |
| [snapshots.md](browser-bridge/snapshots.md) | You are changing what the model *sees*: atom budgeting, `maxChars`, state flags, table rows, respacing, links/images, and the nine `axtree.js` rules that each exist because something real went missing. |
| [extension.md](browser-bridge/extension.md) | You are releasing, signing, or debugging in the field: the one RSA key that is the extension's identity, the policy update channel, build-time origins, verified Chrome/Edge behavior, corporate DLP, and local Playwright verification. |

Two invariants that fail in the FIELD rather than in CI, repeated here because they are cheap to miss:
a new file under `extension/` must be added to `BUNDLE_FILES` (and a BINARY file also to
`BINARY_BUNDLE_FILES`), and `BROWSER_EXTENSION_MIN_COMPATIBLE` must never exceed the bundled manifest
version. Details in [`../../extension/CLAUDE.md`](../../extension/CLAUDE.md).
